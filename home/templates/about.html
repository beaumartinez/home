        <h1 class=title>Hi, I'm Beau</h1>

        <p>I'm a {{ age }}-year–old programmer based in London. I've been programming since I was 14

        <p>I build web apps
        
        <p>I'm passionate about the web. I love data, web scraping, and building hypermedia APIs

        <p>I prefer back-end programming—but I like variety

        <p>I advocate simple, readable, best-practices code; and rapid prototyping

        <p>My language of choice is Python. I use Flask and MongoDB for simple apps and Django and PostreSQL for complex ones

        <p>My editor of choice is Vim. My version control system of choice is git

        <p>I built this entire site myself, from scratch

        <p>Have a look at my <a href=http://github.com/beaumartinez>work</a> and feel free to <a href="mailto:beau@beaumartinez.com?subject=Hi">get in touch</a>
