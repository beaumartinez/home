        <h1 class=title>Hi, I'm Beau <span class=hidden>Martinez</span></h1>

        <p>I'm a London-based back-end developer with {{ years_programming }} years experience.

        <p>I specialise in web apps and web services, and have a particular interest in web scraping.

        <p>I have a no-bullshit approach to software projects. I advocate simple, readable, best-practices code and rapid prototyping.

        <p>My languages of choice are Python and JavaScript.

        <p>Have a look at <a href=http://github.com/beaumartinez>my work</a> and feel free to <a href=mailto:beau@beaumartinez.com>get in touch</a>.
